# test Bot

A Discord card-collecting and RPG bot. Pull anime and game character cards, build your collection, battle players, form clans, and trade with other server members.

## Architecture

- **bot.js** — Main entry point. All Discord command handling and game logic.
- **cards.js** — Card pool and weighted pull logic.
- **config.js** — Pull rates, plating tiers, rarity display metadata, command prefix (`ZP`).
- **inventory.js** — JSON file persistence for user data (`data/inventory.json`). Handles cards, shards, platings, clans, duos, wish, prestige, level caps, guild settings.
- **trades.js** — In-memory trade manager with 5-minute expiry.
- **imageCache.js** — Fetches and caches card artwork from AniList.
- **emojiCache.js** — Uploads card art as custom Discord emojis.

## Running

The bot runs via the "Start application" workflow (`node bot.js`). Requires a `DISCORD_TOKEN` secret.
